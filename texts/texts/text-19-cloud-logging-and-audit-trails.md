# Text 19 – Technical English – Cloud Logging and Audit Trails

## 📄 Text

Cloud logging  
is the process of recording  
system events,  
user actions,  
and operational activities  
in cloud environments.

Logs provide visibility  
into what happens  
inside cloud systems.  
They help security teams  
detect suspicious behavior,  
identify security incidents,  
and investigate potential threats.

Audit trails  
are structured records  
that track access  
and changes made to systems.  
They help organizations  
monitor compliance,  
ensure accountability,  
and support forensic investigations.

Proper logging and auditing  
improve security visibility,  
support incident response,  
and enhance overall system reliability.
