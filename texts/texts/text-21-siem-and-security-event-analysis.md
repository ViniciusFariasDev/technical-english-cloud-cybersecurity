# Text 21 – Technical English – SIEM and Security Event Analysis

## 📄 Text

A Security Information and Event Management system,  
also known as SIEM,  
is a tool used to collect,  
analyze,  
and monitor security events  
from multiple sources.

These sources may include  
servers,  
firewalls,  
endpoints,  
and network devices.  
The SIEM correlates events  
to identify suspicious activity  
and potential security threats.

Security analysts use SIEM platforms  
to investigate alerts,  
detect attacks,  
and respond to incidents.  
By analyzing logs and patterns,  
they can identify unauthorized access,  
malware activity,  
and policy violations.

SIEM systems improve threat visibility,  
support incident response,  
and strengthen overall security monitoring.
