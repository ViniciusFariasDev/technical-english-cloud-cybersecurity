# Text 10 – Technical English – Cloud Security Threats and Risk Management

## 📄 Text

Cloud environments face many security threats,  
such as malware,  
phishing attacks,  
misconfigurations,  
and unauthorized access.  
Understanding these threats  
is essential to protect systems and data.

Risk management involves  
identifying potential risks,  
analyzing their impact,  
and applying controls  
to reduce exposure.  
Security teams assess vulnerabilities  
and prioritize actions  
based on risk level.

Common risk mitigation strategies include  
strong access controls,  
encryption,  
continuous monitoring,  
and regular security assessments.  
Effective risk management improves resilience,  
reduces incidents,  
and supports secure cloud operations.
