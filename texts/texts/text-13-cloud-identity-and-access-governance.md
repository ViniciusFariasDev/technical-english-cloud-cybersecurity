# Text 13 – Technical English – Cloud Identity and Access Governance

## 📄 Text

Identity and access governance  
focuses on controlling  
who can access cloud resources,  
what actions they can perform,  
and under which conditions.

In cloud environments,  
strong identity governance includes  
role-based access control,  
least privilege,  
and periodic access reviews.  
These practices help ensure  
that users only have access  
to what they truly need.

Poor access governance  
may lead to privilege abuse,  
unauthorized actions,  
and security incidents.  
By continuously reviewing permissions  
and monitoring identity activity,  
organizations can reduce risks  
and improve cloud security.
