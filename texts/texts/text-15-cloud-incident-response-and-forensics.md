# Text 15 – Technical English – Cloud Incident Response and Forensics

## 📄 Text

Cloud incident response  
is the process of detecting,  
analyzing,  
and responding to security incidents  
in cloud environments.  
A structured response helps contain threats  
and reduce business impact.

When an incident occurs,  
security teams must identify  
the affected resources,  
collect evidence,  
and determine the root cause.  
This process is known as  
digital forensics.

Cloud forensics relies on  
logs,  
snapshots,  
and audit trails  
to reconstruct attacker activity.  
Preserving evidence correctly  
is essential for investigations  
and legal requirements.

A well-defined incident response plan  
improves reaction time,  
limits damage,  
and helps organizations recover  
securely and efficiently.
