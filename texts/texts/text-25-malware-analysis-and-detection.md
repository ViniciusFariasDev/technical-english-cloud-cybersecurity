# Text 25 – Technical English – Malware Analysis and Detection

## 📄 Text

Malware is malicious software  
designed to damage systems,  
steal data,  
or gain unauthorized access.  
Common types of malware include  
viruses,  
ransomware,  
and trojans.

Malware often enters systems  
through phishing emails,  
infected files,  
or vulnerable applications.  
Once inside,  
it may execute malicious actions  
without user knowledge.

Security teams use detection tools  
such as antivirus,  
EDR,  
and sandbox environments  
to analyze suspicious files.

Malware analysis helps identify  
how malware works,  
its impact,  
and how to remove it.  
Early detection reduces damage  
and improves system security.
