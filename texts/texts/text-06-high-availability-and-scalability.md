# Text 06 – Technical English – High Availability and Scalability

## 📄 Text

High availability means that systems remain accessible  
even when failures occur.  
Cloud providers use redundancy,  
load balancing,  
and automatic recovery  
to minimize downtime  
and maintain service reliability.

Scalability allows systems  
to increase or decrease resources  
based on demand.  
During peak usage,  
additional servers may be added automatically  
to handle higher workloads  
without affecting performance.

Designing systems with high availability  
and scalability ensures stability,  
improves customer experience,  
and supports business growth  
in cloud environments.
