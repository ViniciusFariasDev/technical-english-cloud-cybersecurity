# Text 11 – Technical English – Zero Trust Security in the Cloud

## 📄 Text

Zero Trust is a security model  
based on the principle  
"never trust, always verify".  
In cloud environments,  
this means that no user or system  
is trusted by default,  
even if it is inside the network.

Access is granted only after  
verifying identity,  
device posture,  
and access context.  
Strong authentication,  
least privilege access,  
and continuous monitoring  
are core elements of Zero Trust.

By limiting access and validating  
every request,  
Zero Trust reduces attack surfaces  
and helps prevent lateral movement.  
This model improves visibility,  
security posture,  
and overall system reliability  
in modern cloud architectures.
