# Text 18 – Technical English – Cloud Access Keys and Secret Management

## 📄 Text

Access keys and secrets  
are used to authenticate  
applications and users  
in cloud environments.  
They allow systems  
to securely communicate  
and access cloud resources.

These secrets may include  
API keys,  
passwords,  
tokens,  
and encryption keys.  
If exposed,  
attackers may gain unauthorized access  
to cloud services and data.

Proper secret management  
involves storing secrets securely,  
restricting access,  
and rotating keys regularly.  
Cloud providers offer secret management tools  
to protect sensitive information.

Using secure storage,  
encryption,  
and access controls  
helps prevent secret exposure  
and improves overall cloud security.
