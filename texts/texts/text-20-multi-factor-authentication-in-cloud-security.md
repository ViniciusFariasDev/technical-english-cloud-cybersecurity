# Text 20 – Technical English – Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) in Cloud Security

## 📄 Text

Multi-factor authentication,  
also known as MFA,  
is a security method  
that requires users  
to provide two or more forms  
of verification  
to access cloud systems.

These factors may include  
something the user knows,  
such as a password,  
something the user has,  
such as a mobile device,  
or something the user is,  
such as a fingerprint.

MFA adds an extra layer  
of protection  
and reduces the risk  
of unauthorized access.  
Even if a password is compromised,  
attackers cannot easily access the system  
without additional verification.

Using MFA is considered  
a best practice  
in cloud security  
and helps protect  
sensitive systems and data.
