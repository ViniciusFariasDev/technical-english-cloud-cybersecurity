# Text 23 – Technical English – Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)

## 📄 Text

Endpoint Detection and Response,  
also known as EDR,  
is a security solution  
that monitors endpoint devices  
such as laptops,  
servers,  
and workstations.

EDR tools collect data  
about system activity,  
process execution,  
and user behavior.  
This information helps detect  
suspicious activity  
and potential security threats.

Security analysts use EDR  
to investigate alerts,  
analyze attack behavior,  
and respond to incidents.  
EDR can identify malware,  
unauthorized access,  
and abnormal processes.

EDR improves threat visibility,  
supports incident response,  
and strengthens endpoint security.
