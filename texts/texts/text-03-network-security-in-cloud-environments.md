# Text 03 – Technical English – Network Security in Cloud Environments

## 📄 Text

In cloud environments, network security is essential  
to protect systems and data from external attacks.  
Companies use firewalls, security groups,  
and private networks to control traffic between resources.  
Only authorized traffic should be allowed  
to access sensitive services.

A common mistake is exposing services directly to the internet  
without proper protection.  
This may allow attackers to scan ports,  
exploit vulnerabilities,  
and access internal systems.  
To reduce risks, organizations should segment networks,  
monitor traffic continuously,  
and apply security rules based on the principle  
of least privilege.

Strong network design improves performance,  
reliability, and overall security posture.
