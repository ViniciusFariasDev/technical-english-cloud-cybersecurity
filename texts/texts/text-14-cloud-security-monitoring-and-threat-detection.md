# Text 14 – Technical English – Cloud Security Monitoring and Threat Detection

## 📄 Text

Cloud security monitoring  
focuses on observing systems,  
networks,  
and user activity  
to detect security threats  
and abnormal behavior.

Logs, metrics,  
and alerts provide visibility  
into cloud environments.  
By analyzing this data,  
security teams can identify  
attack patterns,  
misconfigurations,  
and suspicious actions  
in real time.

Threat detection tools,  
such as SIEM and EDR platforms,  
correlate events  
from multiple sources.  
This enables faster incident response,  
reduces potential damage,  
and helps maintain  
system reliability.

Continuous monitoring  
is essential to protect  
modern cloud infrastructures  
and ensure a strong  
security posture.
