# Text 05 – Technical English – Monitoring, Logging and Incident Response

## 📄 Text

Monitoring cloud systems is essential  
to detect performance issues,  
security threats,  
and unusual behavior.  
Logs record activities such as user logins,  
configuration changes,  
and network traffic.

By analyzing logs,  
security teams can identify suspicious patterns  
and respond quickly to incidents.  
Early detection helps reduce damage  
and prevents further security breaches.

Incident response is the process  
of investigating, containing,  
and recovering from security events.  
Automated alerts and dashboards  
help teams react in real time  
and maintain system reliability.

Continuous monitoring improves visibility,  
security posture,  
and operational stability  
in cloud environments.
