# Text 01 – Technical English – Cloud Computing Basics

## 📄 Text

Cloud computing allows companies to store data  
and run applications on remote servers instead of local machines.  
One important concept in cloud security is the shared responsibility model.  
This means that the cloud provider is responsible for securing the infrastructure,  
such as physical data centers, networking, and hardware.  
The customer is responsible for protecting their data,  
managing access permissions, and configuring security settings correctly.

Many security incidents happen because of misconfigured cloud resources,  
like open storage buckets or weak access policies.  
To reduce risks, companies should use strong authentication,  
encryption, regular monitoring, and automated security tools.  
Understanding your responsibilities in the cloud is essential  
to keeping systems secure and reliable.
