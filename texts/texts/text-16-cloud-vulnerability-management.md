# Text 16 – Technical English – Cloud Vulnerability Management

## 📄 Text

Vulnerability management  
is the process of identifying,  
assessing,  
and fixing security weaknesses  
in cloud environments.  
These weaknesses,  
known as vulnerabilities,  
may expose systems to attacks.

Cloud vulnerabilities can exist  
in operating systems,  
applications,  
configurations,  
or access controls.  
If not addressed,  
attackers may exploit them  
to gain unauthorized access.

Security teams use vulnerability scanners  
and monitoring tools  
to detect weaknesses.  
After identification,  
they apply patches,  
update configurations,  
and implement security controls.

Continuous vulnerability management  
helps reduce risk,  
improves system security,  
and ensures cloud environments  
remain protected.
