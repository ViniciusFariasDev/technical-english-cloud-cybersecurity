# Text 07 – Technical English – Backup, Disaster Recovery, and Business Continuity

## 📄 Text

Backups are copies of data  
stored in separate locations  
to protect against data loss,  
cyber attacks,  
and system failures.

In cloud environments,  
backups can be automated  
and stored across multiple regions.  
This approach ensures higher reliability  
and faster recovery  
when incidents occur.

Disaster recovery focuses on  
restoring systems and services  
after major outages or security events.  
A well-defined recovery plan  
reduces downtime  
and helps organizations remain operational.

Business continuity ensures that  
critical operations continue  
even during unexpected disruptions.  
Regular testing of backup  
and recovery procedures  
is essential to maintain trust  
and system reliability.
