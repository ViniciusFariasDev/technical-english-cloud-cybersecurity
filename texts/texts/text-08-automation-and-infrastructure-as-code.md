# Text 08 – Technical English – Automation and Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

## 📄 Text

Automation helps teams deploy  
and manage cloud resources  
quickly and consistently.  
Instead of manual processes,  
scripts and tools are used  
to configure servers,  
networks,  
and security policies automatically.

Infrastructure as Code,  
also known as IaC,  
means defining infrastructure  
using code files.  
These files can be versioned,  
tested,  
and reused across different environments.  
This reduces configuration errors  
and improves reliability.

When issues occur,  
teams can recreate infrastructure  
in a predictable way  
and recover systems faster.  
Automation and IaC support scalability,  
standardization,  
and secure cloud operations.
