# Text 09 – Technical English – Cloud Compliance and Governance

## 📄 Text

Cloud compliance ensures that  
systems follow security standards,  
laws,  
and regulatory requirements.  
Organizations must protect data,  
manage access correctly,  
and maintain proper configurations  
to meet compliance expectations.

Governance in the cloud focuses on  
defining policies,  
controlling resources,  
and monitoring usage across environments.  
This helps prevent misconfigurations,  
reduce risks,  
and maintain operational consistency.

Strong compliance and governance practices  
improve security posture,  
increase trust,  
and support business requirements  
in cloud environments.
