# Text 02 – Technical English – Identity and Access Management (IAM)

## 📄 Text

Identity and Access Management, also known as IAM,  
controls who can access systems, applications, and data in the cloud.  
Instead of sharing passwords, users receive specific permissions  
based on their role.  
This reduces the risk of unauthorized access  
and improves overall security.

For example, a developer may only access development resources,  
while an administrator can manage critical settings and users.  
Many companies use multi-factor authentication  
to add an extra layer of protection.  
Monitoring access logs is also important  
to detect suspicious activity early.

IAM helps organizations follow security best practices  
and maintain compliance with regulations.
