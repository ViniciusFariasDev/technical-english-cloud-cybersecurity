# Text 12 – Technical English – Cloud Shared Responsibility Model

## 📄 Text

The shared responsibility model  
defines how security responsibilities  
are divided between  
the cloud provider  
and the customer.

Cloud providers are responsible  
for securing the infrastructure,  
such as physical data centers,  
hardware,  
and networking components.  
The customer is responsible  
for protecting data,  
managing identities,  
and configuring cloud services correctly.

Security incidents often occur  
due to customer misconfigurations,  
such as open storage buckets  
or weak access controls.  
Understanding the shared responsibility model  
helps organizations reduce risks,  
improve security posture,  
and maintain system reliability.
