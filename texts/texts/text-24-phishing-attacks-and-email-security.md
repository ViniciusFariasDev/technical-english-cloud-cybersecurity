# Text 24 – Technical English – Phishing Attacks and Email Security

## 📄 Text

Phishing is a cyber attack  
that attempts to trick users  
into revealing sensitive information,  
such as passwords,  
credit card numbers,  
or access credentials.

Attackers often send fake emails  
that appear to come  
from trusted organizations.  
These emails may contain  
malicious links  
or infected attachments.

When users click on these links,  
they may be redirected  
to fake websites  
designed to steal their credentials.

Security teams use email filtering,  
user awareness training,  
and threat detection tools  
to prevent phishing attacks.

Proper email security  
reduces the risk of data breaches  
and protects organizational systems.
