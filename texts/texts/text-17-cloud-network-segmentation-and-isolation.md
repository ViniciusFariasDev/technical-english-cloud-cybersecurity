# Text 17 – Technical English – Cloud Network Segmentation and Isolation

## 📄 Text

Network segmentation  
is the practice of dividing  
a cloud network  
into smaller, isolated segments.  
This helps control traffic  
and limit access  
between different systems.

Each segment may contain  
specific workloads,  
applications,  
or services.  
Security rules  
define which traffic  
is allowed or blocked  
between segments.

Isolation reduces the risk  
of lateral movement  
by attackers.  
If one segment is compromised,  
other segments remain protected.

Cloud providers offer tools  
such as virtual private clouds,  
security groups,  
and network access controls  
to implement segmentation.

Proper network segmentation  
improves security,  
reduces attack surface,  
and increases system reliability.
