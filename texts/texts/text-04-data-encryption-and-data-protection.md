# Text 04 – Technical English – Data Encryption and Data Protection

## 📄 Text

Data encryption is one of the most important security controls  
in cloud environments.  
It protects sensitive information  
by converting data into unreadable formats  
that only authorized users can access  
with the correct encryption key.

Encryption can be applied to data at rest,  
data in transit,  
and backups.  
If attackers gain access to encrypted data,  
they cannot read it without the correct key.  
This significantly reduces the impact  
of data breaches.

Organizations must manage encryption keys securely  
and restrict access using the principle  
of least privilege.  
Proper encryption improves confidentiality,  
integrity, and reliability of cloud systems.
