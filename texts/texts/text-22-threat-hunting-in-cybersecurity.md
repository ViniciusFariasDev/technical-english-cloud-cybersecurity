# Text 22 – Technical English – Threat Hunting in Cybersecurity

## 📄 Text

Threat hunting  
is a proactive security activity  
that involves searching for threats  
that may not be detected  
by automated security tools.

Security analysts  
analyze logs,  
network traffic,  
and system behavior  
to identify hidden threats.  
They look for unusual patterns,  
anomalies,  
and indicators of compromise.

Unlike traditional detection,  
threat hunting focuses on  
actively investigating systems  
to find attackers  
before damage occurs.

Threat hunters use tools  
such as SIEM,  
EDR,  
and threat intelligence platforms  
to identify malicious activity.

Threat hunting improves detection capabilities,  
reduces response time,  
and strengthens overall cybersecurity.
